## Replication of:
# SURGICAL FINE-TUNING IMPROVES ADAPTATION TO DISTRIBUTION SHIFTS 
We replicate the code for this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11466 for CS492-I (Fall 2022) class project in KAIST. The code is not avaliable publicly, so we try to do it from scratch.

We use pretrained checkpoint for CIFAR-10 model from here https://github.com/zhangmarvin/memo
